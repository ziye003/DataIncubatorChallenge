# DataIncubatorChallenge

Project description.
As a biologist in the world of machine learning and data science, I'm eager to expand my interdisciplinary skill sets. However, there are so many technical things to learn and I don't know where to start. I believe there are also many other students from different areas of study who wish to know what would be the most powerful tools for them in the field of machine learning. 
Therefore I found this website that showcase trending and influential machine Learning papers called PaperwithCode (https://paperswithcode.com/), and I extract information of interdisciplinary studies from the website, (e.g. medical studies, audio studies ) and I looked for buzzword that is specific to the search in each field.
I scraped the data from the search page using beautiful soup, and then I cleaned up the data using tools such as nltk and pydictionary.
The project helps to find the high frequency words in different fields respectively. It also tells the important term that were viewed important in all different fields.
