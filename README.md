# Analysing trends in interdisciplinary machine learning researches

Project description.
As a biologist in the world of machine learning and data science, I'm eager to expand my interdisciplinary skill sets. However, there are so many technical things to learn and I don't know where to start. I believe there are also many other students from different areas of study who wish to know what would be the most powerful tools for them in the field of machine learning. 
Therefore I found this website that showcase trending and influential machine Learning papers called PaperwithCode (https://paperswithcode.com/), and I extract information of interdisciplinary studies from the website, (e.g. medical studies, audio studies ) and I looked for buzzword that is specific to the search in each field.
I scraped the data from the search page using beautiful soup, and then I did some wrangling and cleaning the data to get a good list of tech words.
The project helps to find the high frequency words in different fields respectively. It also tells the important terms that were viewed important in all different fields. 

In summary, for this project
- Scraped information on interdisciplinary machine learning papers from websites using Beautiful soup and Request.
- Break down paper abstract to word lists.
- Corrected datasets for synonyms and bigrams/trigrams of the dataset using NLTK and PyDictionary toolkit.
- Identified important terms/skills and high-frequency terms in interdisciplinary studies for multiple combinations.
- Presented data using word cloud, venn diagrams and histograms.
